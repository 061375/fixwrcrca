This Annual Report for the third full year of operation was prepared and published by the Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority and addresses the activities of the RCA during the period of January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007.This report builds on the efforts described in the previous Annual Reports for both 2004, 2005, and 2006. <BR><BR><a href="RCA_2007_Annual_Report.pdf">Annual Report 2007 (46.6 MB) (PDF format) </A><BR><BR><B>RCA MSHCP Technical Reports</B><BR><BR>The following reports, methods, and procedures provide the information that was utilized or developed for the Annual Report 2007covering the reporting period of January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007.

The Biological Monitoring Program monitors the distribution and status ofthe 146 Covered Species within the Conservation Area to provide information to Permittees, landmanagers, the public and the Wildlife Agencies (i.e. the California Department of Fish and Gameand the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). Monitoring Program activities are guided by the MSHCPSpecies Objectives for each Covered Species, the MSHCP information needs identified in Section 5.3or elsewhere in the document, and the information needs of the Permittees.<BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_BUOW_Report.pdf"> Burrowing Owl Survey Report 2007 (22 pgs) 1.04MB </a><BR><BR> <A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_CSS_Bird_Report.pdf"> Coastal Sage Scrub Bird Survey Report 2007 (26 pgs) 610KB</a><BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_DelhiFly_Report.pdf"> Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly Survey Report 2007 (20 pgs) 840KB</a><BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_LAPM_Report.pdf"> Los Angeles Pocket Mouse Survey Report 2007 (21 pgs) 1.62MB</a><BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_Oak_Report.pdf"> Engelmann Oak Survey Report 2007 (31 pgs) 1.74MB </a><BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_Pond_Turtle_Report.pdf"> Western Pond Turtle Survey Report 2007 (67 pgs) 5.50MB</a><BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_Quino_Report.pdf"> Quino Checkerspot Butterfly Survey Report 2007 (10 pgs) </a><BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_Rare_Plant_Report.pdf"> Rare Plant Survey Report 2007 (43 pgs) 1.83MB </a><BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_Riparian_Bird_Report.pdf"> Riparian Bird Survey Report 2007 (35 pgs) .99MB</a><BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_SKR_Report.pdf">Stephens' Kangaroo Rat Survey Report 2007 (43 pgs) 4.48MB </a><BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_Stream_Report.pdf">Stream Survey Report 2007 (48 pgs) 4.01MB</a><BR><BR><A href="RCA_2007_AR_TR_Monitor_Incidental_Observations_Report.pdf"> Incidental Observations of MSHCP Covered Species in 2007 (5 pgs)</a><BR><BR><B> 3. Habitrak Reports</B><BR>The MSHCP and Implementing agreement requires that the RCA use Habitrak or a methodology consistent for reporting. The annual report was developed utilizing the methodology using GIS as described in Appendix A of the Annual Report. The analysis, tables, reports and maps for both the Annual Report and Habitrak Report Formats were developed using this GIS dataset. The following reports and maps provide detail information on the projects and data assembled for reporting and summarized in the annual report. <BR><BR>The Habitrak Application creates a series of tabular reports in a line by line listing of projects and permitsselected information from the gains or losses information from each reporting year. In the 2005 Annual Report,these four tabular reports were created from the GIS shape files using the Crystal Reports application providedwith ESRI ArcGIs and they consisted of a total of 1191 pages.<BR><BR>Due to the large number of records reported on each year for the Annual Report, these Gains and Losses reports as well asthe Habitat Vegetation reports are not very easy to use or find individual records on projects. The RCA has attemptedto structure and keep the GIS Shapefiles in a structure that could be used with the existing and revised HabitrakApplications if needed. Several options are provided below to examine the GIS data or recreate the tabular reportsif needed:<BR><OL> <LI>Use the Crystal Reports in ESRI ArcGIS on the 2007 Gains and Losses files to create any reports needed. </LI> <LI>Import the appropriate GIS Gains and Losses files into the Habitrak Application and use it to create the reports. We recommend a review of the Habitrak Documentation on attributes used in the application with the metadata on the attributes provided in this Annual Report before importing files. Some attribute/field names may need to be changed or field sizes may need to be adjusted. </LI> <LI>Use ESRI ArcGIS, ArcView or ArcExplorer to geographically examine individual projects of interest and the loss and gain records details within the tables. If you do not have access to ArcGIS or ArcView the ESRI ArcExplorer can be used. ESRI ArcExplorer is a free application that is provided by ESRI that can be used to view the GIS Gains and Losses files. To obtain and download a copy of ESRI ArcExplorer the following URL can be used: <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/explorer/index.html">ESRI ArcExplorer Application (www.esri.com) </a> </LI></OL><B>Gains and Losses Maps</B><BR>The Annual Report includes maps by Rough Step Areas for gains and losses within the MSHCP Criteria Cells. The following maps were developed in an 11" x 17" format by Rough Step Unit to show both the gains and losseswithin MSHCP Criteria Cells and for the surrounding areas of each rough step that cover the entire Western Riverside County MSHCP area. <BR><BR><a href="AnnualReport_Habitrak_RSIndex_2007.pdf">Rough Step Unit Index Map for 2007 ( 2.22 MB)</A><BR> <a href="AnnualReport_Habitrak_RS1_2007.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 1 - Gains and Losses 2007 ( 5.12 MB)</A><BR><a href="AnnualReport_Habitrak_RS2_2007.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 2 - Gains and Losses 2007 ( 4.80 MB)</A><BR><a href="AnnualReport_Habitrak_RS3_2007.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 3 - Gains and Losses 2007 ( 5.00 MB)</A><BR><a href="AnnualReport_Habitrak_RS4_2007.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 4 - Gains and Losses 2007 ( 3.10 MB)</A><BR> <a href="AnnualReport_Habitrak_RS5_2007.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 5 - Gains and Losses 2007 ( 4.85 MB)</A><BR><a href="AnnualReport_Habitrak_RS6_2007.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 6 - Gains and Losses 2007 ( 5.76 MB)</A><BR><a href="AnnualReport_Habitrak_RS7_2007.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 7 - Gains and Losses 2007 ( 5.26 MB)</A><BR><a href="AnnualReport_Habitrak_RS8_2007.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 8 - Gains and Losses 2007 ( 4.30 MB)</A><BR><a href="AnnualReport_Habitrak_RS9_2007.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 9 - Gains and Losses 2007 ( 3.28 MB)</A><BR><BR>Western Riverside County - Permits and Project Losses -June 22, 2004 through December 31, 2007.

Clerical Amendments to the MSHCP </B><BR>The MSHCP and Implementing agreement requires that the RCA report any clerical amendments or changes to the MSHCP Documents.

Agricultural Operations Database</B><BR>The Implementation Agreement for the MSHCP in section 11.3 required that the RCA and County establisha Agricultural Operations database and report on agricultural activities such as agricultural gradingpermits issued each year. Agricultural grading permits are included within the GIS Loss files for eachreporting year. For the 2007 Annual Report the agricultural operations data base was updated with anyAgricultural Grading Permits issued during 2007.
