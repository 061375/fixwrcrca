Habitrak Reports</B><BR>The MSHCP and Implementing agreement suggested that the RCA use an existing GIS-based habitat tracking model or (equivalent) called Habitrak that was built on ESRI arcView or another methodology consistent with that application for reporting. Based on the size of the datasets involved for the Western Riverside County MSHCP, complexity of the MSHCP, and the large number of permtis and projects the RCA elected to develop an alternative process that created files compatible with Habitrak but based on ESRI ArcGIS that provide the same information.<BR><BR>The annual report was developed utilizing the methodology using GIS as described in Appendix A - 1. GIS Methodology, Process and Procedures of the Annual Report. The analysis, tables, reports and maps for both the Annual Report and Habitrak Map Formats were developed using these GIS datasets. The following maps provide detail information on the projects and data assembled for reporting and summarized in the annual report.<BR> <BR><B>Gains and Losses Maps</B><BR>The Annual Report includes maps by Rough Step Areas for gains and losses for all reporting years within the MSHCP Criteria Cells. The following maps were developed in an 11" x 17" format by Rough Step Unit to show both the gains and losses within MSHCP Criteria Cells and for the surrounding areas of each rough step that cover the entire Western Riverside County MSHCP area. <BR><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2012_RS_Index.pdf">Rough Step Unit Index Map for 2012 ( 1.64 MB)</A><BR> <a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2012_Map_RS1.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 1 - Gains and Losses 2012 ( 2.20 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2012_Map_RS2.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 2 - Gains and Losses 2012 ( 2.14 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2012_Map_RS3.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 3 - Gains and Losses 2012 ( 2.11 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2012_Map_RS4.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 4 - Gains and Losses 2012 ( 1.49 MB)</A><BR> <a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2012_Map_RS5.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 5 - Gains and Losses 2012 ( 2.20 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2012_Map_RS6.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 6 - Gains and Losses 2012 ( 2.52MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2012_Map_RS7.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 7 - Gains and Losses 2012 ( 2.18 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2012_Map_RS8.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 8 - Gains and Losses 2012 ( 2.05 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2012_Map_RS9.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 9 - Gains and Losses 2012 ( 1.58 MB)</A><BR><BR>Western Riverside County - Permits and Project Losses -June 22, 2004 through December 31, 2012.

Agricultural Operations Database Methodology</B><BR>The Implementation Agreement for the MSHCP in section 11.3 required that the RCA and County establisha Agricultural Operations database and report on agricultural activities such as agricultural gradingpermits issued each year. Agricultural grading permits are included within the GIS Loss files for eachreporting year. For the 2012 Annual Report there was an addition of 215.36 acres to the agricultural operationsdata base. A total of sixteen Agriculture Grading Permits were issued by the County in 2012 in the MSHCP Area. The current map as of 12/31/2012 are included as part of the Annual Report for 2012.<BR> <BR><B>Agricultural Operations Map </B><BR><a href="AppendixA/WRC_Agricultural_Lands_100dpi_12312012.pdf"> Agricultural Operations Map 12/31/2012 100dpi (36" x 60") 5.3 MB</A><BR><BR><a href="AppendixA/WRC_Agricultural_Lands_300dpi_12312012.pdf"> Agricultural Operations Map 12/31/2012 300dpi (36" x 60") 58.6 MB</A><BR><BR><BR><B> 6. Development Projects - Future Conservation </B><BR>The Joint Project Review (JPR) - Habitat Evaluation and Acquisition Negotiation Process (HANS) performed by the RCA and the Permittees on proposed development projects is used as the basis for developing this new data layer. These JPR and HANS projects after review have had the development footprint and areas described for conservation outlined within the project area within the RCA GIS JPR database. The JPR database was used as the basis for developing this file and all records that had completed the JPR review and designated portions of the lands to be conserved were saved to this file. Any projects that had been acquired by the RCA or had conservation easements were then removed from the file.<BR><BR>The update process and methods as described in the included documentation file WRC_RCA_Future_Conservation.pdf was used to remove all parcels that had been acquired by the RCA or other conservation entities. The JPR projects for 2012 that were processed and completed designating new conservation were then added to the GIS layer. As of December 31, 2012 approximately 9,857 acres have been designated as future conservation through development.<BR> <BR><a href="AppendixA/WRC_RCA_AR_Future_Conservation.pdf"> Future Conservation as of December 31, 2012 - Update process and documentation</A><BR><BR><BR><B> 7. Non RCA Conservation and Easements </B><BR>These parcels acquired through a Grant Deed or conserved through a Conservation Easement have been verified through the review of the recorded deed. The grant deeds, easement deeds or conservation easements as recorded by the Riverside County Clerk and Recorder as official records of Riverside County were downloaded to several folders on the RCA Server. Each grant deed or easement deed has been located and tied to the particular parcel it describes. These deeds are held by conservation entities such as the Riverside Land Conservancy (RLC), The Center for Natural Lands Management (CNLM) or other conservation non-profit corporations that are involved in conservation of lands for open space.<BR><BR>The lands identified as being in a conservation status through a conservation easement or owned by the Conservation Entity and acquired through a grant deed are located within the areas described for Conservation (MSHCP Criteria Cells) as well as outside the cell boundaries. A review was performed to make sure that the lands entered into this file had not been previously identified as Public Quasi Public Lands or that the lands in question have been acquired by the RCA.<BR> <BR>The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Riverside Corona Resource Conservation District (RCRCD) assures that RCRCD Lands are managed and monitored under the MSHCP. RCRCD lands within Criteria Cells will be counted toward the Rough Step within the Rough Step Units since they are conservation status and managed under the Plan. Currently a total of 305 acres are managed by RCRCD under conservation easements and fee title under the MOU and MSHCP Plan. Of those acres a total of 297 acres are within criteria cells and count towards Rough Step. In a later reporting year it will be determined what lands held by RCRCD will be counted towards Reserve Assembly and what lands will be considered PQP. The RCA is working with other conservation entities to develop MOU’s to have their lands managed under the MSHCP.<BR><BR>Additional lands that have been conserved were added for the 2012 Annual Report through the new update process. The details can be found in the <a href="AppendixA/RCA_2012_AR_TR_GIS_Methods_Procedures.pdf"> RCA_2012_AR_TR_GIS_Methods_Procedures.pdf </A> document that has been included with this report.<BR><BR><BR><B> 8. Technical Report - GIS Assessor Parcel Layer </B><BR>The RCA GIS staff found in August of 2011 that the Riverside County Assessor changed the way they were updating the parcel layer as part of their maintenance process. This change created a variety of problems that were uncovered during an extensive analysis project. In essence the County Assessor independently made a decision to adjust the parcel base without coordination with the other Agencies and Departments using the GIS. Assessors Staff chose to rubber sheet the Assessor’s parcel layer to Aerial Orthophotos so that the “parcels would match the picture”. This new procedure shifted the parcel base in different areas and the parcels no longer match the parcel (survey monuments) control layer and street centerline network. Other GIS layers representing city boundaries and other jurisdictional boundaries now split parcels. This technical report documents some of the changes in the parcel layer as currently known when compared to the original parcel base. The technical report also documents and discusses the impact on the Western Riverside County MSHCP as currently known. The long term effect of this shift cannot be determined at this time and these changes will need to be monitored to determine the effects in future years.<BR> <BR><a href="AppendixA/RCA_2012_AR_TR_GIS_Assessor_Parcels.pdf"> Technical Report on GIS Parcel Base (County Assessor, TLMA and RCA) (13 pages) </A><BR><BR><BR><B> 9. Technical Report - MSHCP Vegetation Corrections </B><BR>In the 2012 Annual Report is a process to account for corrections to Rough Step vegetation categories based on a review of specific individual development projects that have resulted in a loss to the Rough Step vegetation category. Detailed analysis of a specific vegetation type that was out of rough step in one of the units led to the discovery that the vegetation that was shown as a loss for the project was not correctly mapped within the MSHCP vegetation layer. As a result a series of discussions were held with the Wildlife agencies regarding the mapping errors and concurrence was reached by all parties that the vegetation in fact had not been disturbed as a result of the development project. This resulted in a detailed process and methodology to account for the correction while not modifying either the MSHCP vegetation layer or loss data for that development. The technical report describes the process and procedures that are needed to both document the corrections and then apply the corrections to the Rough Step formula calculations.<BR> <BR><a href="AppendixA/RCA_2012_AR_TR_MSHCP_Vegetation_Corrections.pdf">Technical Report on process for MSHCP Vegetation Corrections (5 pages) </A><BR><BR><BR><HR Size="+5" Width="100%" Noshade> <BR><BR><B>Address: <BR>Western Riverside County <BR>Regional Conservation Authority <BR>3403 10th Street, Suite 320 floor <BR>Riverside, CA 92501</B><BR><BR><B>Contact</B><BR>Toby Soto<BR>Chief of Technical Information<BR><BR>Phone (951) 955-9700 &nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp; Fax (951) 955-8873<BR>Normal Business Hours: <br>Monday through Friday from 8:00am to 5:00pm<BR><BR><a href="http://www.wrc-rca.org"> Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority Home Page </a><BR><BR><HR><BR></body></Html>
