<H2><B>Annual Report</B></H2>

The permits were issued on June 22, 2004 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish and Game. 
This Annual Report for the second full year of operation was prepared and published by the Western Riverside County Regional 
Conservation Authority and addresses the activities of the RCA during the period of January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006.
This report builds on the efforts described in the previous Annual Reports for both 2004 and 2005.

The following reports, methods, and procedures provide the information that was utilized or developed for the Annual Report 2006
covering the reporting period of January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. This information is provided in a separate set of
documents due to the technical content and detail provided within these reports. <BR>

<BR>
Separate documents and reports account for the survey activities undertaken by the Biological 
Monitoring Program for the Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
(MSHCP) during 2006. The Biological Monitoring Program monitors the distribution and status of
the 146 Covered Species within the Conservation Area to provide information to Permittees, land
managers, the public and the Wildlife Agencies (i.e. the California Department of Fish and Game
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).  Monitoring Program activities are guided by the MSHCP
Species Objectives for each Covered Species, the MSHCP information needs identified in Section 5.3
or elsewhere in the document, and the information needs of the Permittees.<BR><BR>

<B> 3. Habitrak Reports</B><BR>
The MSHCP and Implementing agreement requires that the RCA use Habitrak or a methodology consistent for reporting. The annual 
report was developed utilizing the methodology using GIS as described in Appendix A of the Annual Report. The  analysis, 
tables, reports and maps for both the Annual Report and Habitrak Report Formats were developed using this GIS dataset. 
The following reports and maps provide detail information on the projects and data assembled for reporting and summarized 
in the annual report. 
<BR><BR>
The Habitrak Application as used by San Diego creates a series of tabular reports in a line by line listing of
selected information from the gains or losses information from each reporting year. In the 2005 Annual Report,
these four tabular reports were created from the GIS shape files using the Crystal Reports application provided
with ESRI ArcGIs and they consisted of a total of 1191 pages.<BR>
<BR>
<B> Habitrak - Summary and Detailed Tabular Data Reports</B><BR>
Summary of Acqusitions and Gains Report<BR>
Summary of Project and Permit Losses Report<BR>
Detailed Summary of Habitat - Vegetation Gains and Acquisitions Report<BR>
Detailed Summary of Habitat - Vegetation Project and Permit Losses Report<BR>
<BR>
Due to the number of records reported on each year for the Annual Report, these Gains and Losses reports as well as
the Habitat Vegetation reports are not very easy to use or find individual records on projects. The RCA has attempted
to structure and keep the GIS Shapefiles in a structure that could be used with the existing and revised Habitrak
Applications if needed. Several options are provided below to examine the GIS data or recreate the tabular reports
if needed:<BR>

<OL>
   <LI>Use the Crystal Reports in ESRI ArcGIS on the 2006 Gains and Losses files to create any 
   reports needed. 
   </LI>
   <LI>Import the appropriate GIS Gains and Losses files into the Habitrak Application and 
   use it to create the reports. We recommend a review of the Habitrak Documentation on attributes 
   used in the application with the metadata on the attributes provided in this Annual Report before 
   importing files. Some attribute/field names may need to be changed or field sizes may need to 
   be adjusted. 
   </LI>
   <LI>Use ESRI ArcGIS, ArcView or ArcExplorer to geographically examine individual projects 
   of interest and loss and gain records details.
   </LI>
</OL>

<BR>
<B>Gains and Losses Maps</B><BR>
The Annual Report includes maps by Rough Step Areas for gains and losses within the MSHCP Criteria Cells. 
The following maps were developed in an 11" x 17" format by Rough Step Unit to show both the gains and losses
within MSHCP Criteria Cells and for the surrounding areas of each rough step that cover the entire 
Western Riverside County MSHCP area.

<B> 4. Clerical Amendments to the MSHCP </B><BR>
The MSHCP and Implementing agreement requires that the RCA report any clerical amendments or changes to the MSHCP Documents.
<BR><BR>
No Clerical Amendments are identified in the Annual Report for 2006.
<BR>
<BR>

<B> 5. Agricultural Operations Database</B><BR>
The Implementation Agreement for the MSHCP in section 11.3 required that the RCA and County establish
a Agricultural Operations database and report on agricultural activities such as agricultural grading
permits issued each year. Agricultural grading permits are included within the GIS Loss files for each
reporting year. In 2006 the review of the agricultural operations data base was completed and the GIS
files and current map as of 12/31/2006 are included as part of the Annual Report for 2006.
