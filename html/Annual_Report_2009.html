Monitoring Survey Results and Reports</B><BR><BR>Separate documents and reports account for the survey activities undertaken by the Biological Monitoring Program for the Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan(MSHCP) during 2009. The Biological Monitoring Program monitors the distribution and status ofthe 146 Covered Species within the Conservation Area to provide information to Permittees, landmanagers, the public and the Wildlife Agencies (i.e. the California Department of Fish and Gameand the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). Monitoring Program activities are guided by the MSHCPSpecies Objectives for each Covered Species, the MSHCP information needs identified in Section 5.3or elsewhere in the document, and the information needs of the Permittees.<BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Artificial_Cover.pdf"> Artificial Cover Survey Report 2009 (20 pgs) 1.44 MB </a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Carnivore.pdf"> Carnivore Survey Report 2009 (33 pgs) 1.97 MB </a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_DSF_Report.pdf"> Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly <I>(Rhaphiomidas terminatus abdominalis)</I> Survey Report 2009 (30 pgs) 1.30 MB</a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Engelmann_Oak.pdf"> Engelmann Oak <i>(Quercus engelmannii)</i> Recruitment Survey Report 2009 (22 pgs) 4.20 MB </a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Gecko.pdf"> San Diego Banded Gecko <i>(Coleonyx variegatus abbotti)</i> Survey Report 2009 (19 pgs) 1.79 MB</a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Harrier.pdf"> Northern Harrier <I>(Circus cyaneus)</I> Breeding Survey Report 2009 (30 pgs) 1.17 MB</a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Lake_Birds.pdf"> Lake Birds Survey Report 2009 (25 pgs) 1.01 MB </a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Penstemon_californicus.pdf"> California Beardtongue <I>(Penstemon californicus)</I> Detectability Project 2009 (23 pgs) 19.50 MB</a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Pond_Turtle.pdf"> Southwestern Pond Turtle <I>(Actinemys marmorata pallida)</I> Survey Report 2009 (17 pgs) 1.78 MB</a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Quino.pdf"> Quino Checkerspot Butterfly <I>(Euphydryas editha quino)</I> Survey Report 2009 (52 pgs) 3.69 MB</a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Raptor.pdf"> Overwintering Raptor Survey Report 2009 (20 pgs) 1.11 MB </a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Rare_Plants.pdf"> Rare Plants Survey Report 2009 (39 pgs) 3.93 MB </a><BR><BR><A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Streams.pdf"> Stream Survey Report 2009 (19 pgs) 1.04 MB</a><BR><BR> <A href="AppendixA/RCA_2009_AR_TR_Monitor_Veg_Community.pdf"> Vegetation Community Survey Report 2009 (14 pgs) 1.14 MB</a><BR><BR><BR><B> 3.

Habitrak Reports</B><BR>The MSHCP and Implementing agreement requires that the RCA use Habitrak or a methodology consistent for reporting. The annual report was developed utilizing the methodology using GIS as described in Appendix A - 1. GIS Methodology, Process and Procedures of the Annual Report. The analysis, tables, reports and maps for both the Annual Report and Habitrak Map Formats were developed using these GIS datasets. The following reports and maps provide detail information on the projects and data assembled for reporting and summarized in the annual report. <BR><BR>The original Habitrak Application creates a series of tabular reports in a line by line listing of projects and permits selected information from the gains or losses information from each reporting year. In the 2005 Annual Report,these four tabular reports were created from the GIS shape files using the Crystal Reports application providedwith ESRI ArcGIS and they consisted of a total of 1191 pages.<BR><BR>Due to the large number of records reported on each year for the Annual Report, these Gains and Losses reports as well asthe Habitat Vegetation reports are not very easy to use or find individual records on projects. The RCA has attemptedto structure and keep the GIS Shapefiles in a structure that could be used with the existing and revised HabitrakApplications if needed. Several options are provided below to examine the GIS data or recreate the tabular reportsif needed:<BR><OL> <LI>Use the Crystal Reports in ESRI ArcGIS on the 2009 Gains and Losses files to create any reports needed. </LI> <LI>Import the appropriate GIS Gains and Losses files into the Habitrak Application and use it to create the reports. We recommend a review of the Habitrak Documentation on attributes used in the application with the metadata on the attributes provided in this Annual Report before importing files. Some attribute/field names may need to be changed or field sizes may need to be adjusted. </LI> <LI>Use ESRI ArcGIS, ArcView or ArcExplorer to geographically examine individual projects of interest and loss and gain records details. </LI></OL><B>Gains and Losses Maps</B><BR>The Annual Report includes maps by Rough Step Areas for gains and losses within the MSHCP Criteria Cells. The following maps were developed in an 11" x 17" format by Rough Step Unit to show both the gains and losseswithin MSHCP Criteria Cells and for the surrounding areas of each rough step that cover the entire Western Riverside County MSHCP area. <BR><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2009_RS_Index.pdf">Rough Step Unit Index Map for 2009 ( 696 KB)</A><BR> <a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2009_Map_RS1.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 1 - Gains and Losses 2009 ( 948 KB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2009_Map_RS2.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 2 - Gains and Losses 2009 ( 972 KB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2009_Map_RS3.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 3 - Gains and Losses 2009 ( 940 KB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2009_Map_RS4.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 4 - Gains and Losses 2009 ( 683 KB)</A><BR> <a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2009_Map_RS5.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 5 - Gains and Losses 2009 ( 964 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2009_Map_RS6.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 6 - Gains and Losses 2009 ( 1.10 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2009_Map_RS7.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 7 - Gains and Losses 2009 ( .98 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2009_Map_RS8.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 8 - Gains and Losses 2009 ( 984 KB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2009_Map_RS9.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 9 - Gains and Losses 2009 ( 819 KB)</A><BR><BR>Western Riverside County - Permits and Project Losses -June 22, 2004 through December 31, 2009.

Agricultural Operations Database Methodology, Metadata and GIS Files</B><BR>The Implementation Agreement for the MSHCP in section 11.3 required that the RCA and County establisha Agricultural Operations database and report on agricultural activities such as agricultural gradingpermits issued each year. Agricultural grading permits are included within the GIS Loss files for eachreporting year. For the 2009 Annual Report the agricultural operations data base was updated with theone Agricultural Certificate of Inclusion issued during 2009.
