Habitrak Reports</B><BR>The MSHCP and Implementing agreement requires that the RCA use Habitrak or a methodology consistent for reporting. The annual report was developed utilizing the methodology using GIS as described in Appendix A - 1. GIS Methodology, Process and Procedures of the Annual Report. The analysis, tables, reports and maps for both the Annual Report and Habitrak Map Formats were developed using these GIS datasets. The following reports and maps provide detail information on the projects and data assembled for reporting and summarized in the annual report. <BR><BR>The original Habitrak Application creates a series of tabular reports in a line by line listing of projects and permits selected information from the gains or losses information from each reporting year. In the 2005 Annual Report,these four tabular reports were created from the GIS shape files using the Crystal Reports application providedwith ESRI ArcGIS and they consisted of a total of 1191 pages.<BR><BR>Due to the large number of records reported on each year for the Annual Report, these Gains and Losses reports as well asthe Habitat Vegetation reports are not very easy to use or find individual records on projects. The RCA has attemptedto structure and keep the GIS Shapefiles in a structure that could be used with the existing and revised HabitrakApplications if needed. Several options are provided below to examine the GIS data or recreate the tabular reportsif needed:<BR><OL> <LI>Use the Crystal Reports in ESRI ArcGIS on the 2010 Gains and Losses files to create any reports needed. </LI> <LI>Import the appropriate GIS Gains and Losses files into the Habitrak Application and use it to create the reports. We recommend a review of the Habitrak Documentation on attributes used in the application with the metadata on the attributes provided in this Annual Report before importing files. Some attribute/field names may need to be changed or field sizes may need to be adjusted. </LI> <LI>Use ESRI ArcGIS, ArcView or ArcExplorer to geographically examine individual projects of interest and loss and gain records details. </LI></OL><B>Gains and Losses Maps</B><BR>The Annual Report includes maps by Rough Step Areas for gains and losses within the MSHCP Criteria Cells. The following maps were developed in an 11" x 17" format by Rough Step Unit to show both the gains and losseswithin MSHCP Criteria Cells and for the surrounding areas of each rough step that cover the entire Western Riverside County MSHCP area. <BR><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2010_RS_Index.pdf">Rough Step Unit Index Map for 2010 ( 1.65 MB)</A><BR> <a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2010_Map_RS1.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 1 - Gains and Losses 2010 ( 2.36 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2010_Map_RS2.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 2 - Gains and Losses 2010 ( 2.44 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2010_Map_RS3.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 3 - Gains and Losses 2010 ( 2.33 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2010_Map_RS4.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 4 - Gains and Losses 2010 ( 1.61 MB)</A><BR> <a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2010_Map_RS5.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 5 - Gains and Losses 2010 ( 2.32 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2010_Map_RS6.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 6 - Gains and Losses 2010 ( 2.72 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2010_Map_RS7.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 7 - Gains and Losses 2010 ( 2.41 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2010_Map_RS8.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 8 - Gains and Losses 2010 ( 2.21 MB)</A><BR><a href="AppendixA/Annual_Report_2010_Map_RS9.pdf">WRC Rough Step Unit 9 - Gains and Losses 2010 ( 1.85 MB)</A><BR><BR>Western Riverside County - Permits and Project Losses -June 22, 2004 through December 31, 2010.

Agricultural Operations Database Methodology, Metadata and GIS Files</B><BR>The Implementation Agreement for the MSHCP in section 11.3 required that the RCA and County establisha Agricultural Operations database and report on agricultural activities such as agricultural gradingpermits issued each year. Agricultural grading permits are included within the GIS Loss files for eachreporting year. For the 2010 Annual Report there were not any additions to the agricultural operationsdata base. One Agriculture Grading Permit was issued but it had been previoulsy reported as a gradingpermit in 2005. The parcel also was previously shown as an Ag Grading Permit from 2006 and was alreadyshown as in agricultural status within the data base.

Development Projects - Future Conservation GIS Data Files </B><BR>New for the 2010 Annual Report is a new data layer that represents conservation that will be acquiredat some point in time in the future by the RCA through the Development Process.<BR><BR>The Joint Project Review (JPR) - Habitat Evaluation and Acquisition Negotiation Process (HANS) performedby the RCA and the Permittees on proposed development projects is used as the basis for developing thisnew data layer. These JPR and HANS projects after review have had the development footprint and areas describedfor conservation outlined within the project area within the RCA GIS JPR database. The JPR database wasused as the basis for developing this file and all records that had completed the JPR review and designated portions of the lands to be conserved were saved to this file. Any projects that had been acquired by the RCAor had conservation easements were then removed from the file.<BR> <BR>This new GIS layer is not used in the Rough Step Analysis but it does serve to provide a indication ofconservation that will be acquired through the development process when it finally occurs. As of December 31, 2010approximately 8,405 acres have been designated as future conservation through development.<BR><BR>Development Projects - Future Conservation GIS Metadata Files as of December 31, 2010<BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_RCA_AR_Future_Conservation.htm"> Future Conservation as of December 31, 2010</A><BR><BR>Please contact RCA Staff as described in Metadata for all GIS files.<BR><BR><B> 8. Non RCA Conservation and Easements GIS Data Files </B><BR>New for the 2010 Annual Report is a new data layer that represents conservation land that is either owned or secured through a conservation easement by entities other than the Regional Conservation Authority.<BR><BR>These parcels acquired through a Grant Deed or conserved through a Conservation Easement have been verifiedthrough the review of the recorded deed. The grant deeds, easement deeds or conservation easements as recorded by the Riverside County Clerk and Recorder as official records of Riverside County were downloadedto several folders on the RCA Server. Each grant deed or easement deed has been located and tied to the particularparcel it describes. These deeds are held by conservation entities such as the Riverside Land Conservancy (RLC),The Center for Natural Lands Management (CNLM) or other conservation non-profit corporations that are involved in conservation of lands for open space.<BR><BR>The lands identified as being in a conservation status through a conservation easement or owned by the Conservation Entity and acquired through a grant deed are located within the areas described for Conservation (MSHCP Criteria Cells) as well as outside the cell boundaries. A review was performed to make sure that the lands entered into this file had not been previously identified as Public Quasi Public Lands or that the lands in question have been acquired by the RCA. <BR><BR>In 2010 a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by the Regional Conservation Authority and the RiversideCorona Resource Conservation District (RCRCD) was signed in June. This MOU assures that RCRCD Lands will be managed and monitored under the MSHCP for Western Riverside County. The RCRCD lands within Criteria Cells will be counted toward the Rough Step within the Rough Step Units since they are conservation status and managed under the Plan.Currently a total of 208.905 acres are managed by RCRCD under conservation easements and fee title under the MOU and MSHCP Plan. Of those acres a total of 188.531 acres are within criteria cells and count towards Rough Step. In a later reporting year it will be determined what lands held by RCRCD will be counted towards Reserve Assembly and what lands will be considered PQP. <BR><BR>Non RCA Conservation and Easements Metadata files for the MSHCP as of December 31, 2010<BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Non_RCA_Conservation_Easements.htm"> Non RCA Conservation and Easements as of December 31, 2010</A><BR><BR>Please contact RCA Staff as described in Metadata for all GIS files.<BR><BR><B> 9. GIS Data Files </B><BR>The GIS Shape Files can be found in the subdirectory of GIS-Data on this CD. These files are inESRI Shape file format and require <A href="http://www.ESRI.com">ESRI</A> ArcGIS for Analysis. These files are provided as the source for the analysis of the Rough Step Units, Area Plans and Jurisdictions for both losses and gains to the vegetation communities for the MSHCP. Any use and analysis of these files requires both a review and understanding of the included document: <A href="AppendixA/RCA_2010_AR_TR_GIS_Methods_Procedures.pdf"> GIS Methods and Procedures (PDF format) </A>. The documentation describes how these files were prepared and other critical information such as the Potrero Tradeout Lands as well as those properties used or notused for the Rough Step Calculations. To properly utilize and understand the data in these files a reviewof this document is required so that the information can be exactly replicated as presented in the Annual Reportfor 2010.<BR><BR>To prepare maps and other analysis these GIS data files may need to be used with other GIS data from the<A href="http://www.rctlma.org/gis">County of Riverside GIS</A>.<BR><BR><B>Any GIS Files acquired from the RCA may not be modified or edited.<BR> Please contact RCA Staff on any concerns, corrections or to acquire the GIS shapefiles as described in the Metadata.</B><BR><BR><Font=+1><B>GIS Metadata for Shape Files</B><BR></Font><BR>Acquisitions and Gains GIS Files Metadata<BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Acquisitions_Gains_Prior_06222004.htm"> Acquisitions and Gains Prior to June 22, 2004</A><BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Acquisitions_Gains_2004.htm"> Acquisitions and Gains for Annual Report 2004</A><BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Acquisitions_Gains_2005.htm"> Acquisitions and Gains for Annual Report 2005</A><BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Acquisitions_Gains_2006.htm"> Acquisitions and Gains for Annual Report 2006</A><BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Acquisitions_Gains_2007.htm"> Acquisitions and Gains for Annual Report 2007</A><BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Acquisitions_Gains_2008.htm"> Acquisitions and Gains for Annual Report 2008</A><BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Acquisitions_Gains_2009.htm"> Acquisitions and Gains for Annual Report 2009</A><BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Acquisitions_Gains_2010.htm"> Acquisitions and Gains for Annual Report 2010</A><BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_RCA_AR_Acquisitions_Gains.htm"> Acquisitions and Gains during the period of February 2000 through December 31, 2010</A><BR><BR>Project and Permit Losses GIS Files Metadata<BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Project_Losses_2004.htm"> Project Losses for Annual Report 2004 (MSHCP Losses)</A><BR><BR><a href="GIS-Data/WRC_Project_Losses_Corrected_2004.htm"> Project Losses from 2004 as corrected for Annual Report 2010</A><BR>&nbsp;
